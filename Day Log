that should be my silver bullet
Day 4
- Embeded Builder progress! Updates the message. Stole code from stack
Day 5
- Reading the book again,
you can make java calculate strictly using 64bit is you use strictfp (Strict Floating point) this is so that no matter what VM your on it will always produce the same accuracy
that also means it will give the save value. This is only really applicable in high precision floating point number calculations. if you need that level of accuracy use strict fp
This book is also quite funnny at times "If your eyes glazed over when reading this note"
Day 6
- More Reading into the order or operators and learning the difference in string manipulation in c++ vs Java
